## Abstract

Air pollution causes over 1.6 million premature deaths annually in India. Yet, decision-makers face persistent barriers in turning diverse tabular data on air pollution, population, and funding into actionable insights. Existing tools demand technical expertise, offer shallow visualizations, or rely on static dashboards, leaving policy questions unresolved.

Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by translating natural-language questions into structured, multi-dataset analyses; however, their reliability for such domain-specific tasks remains unknown.

We present **VayuBench**, to our knowledge, the first executable benchmark for air-quality analytics. It comprises 5,000 natural-language queries paired with verified Python code across seven query categories: spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, population-based, area-based, funding-related and specific pattern queries over multiple real-world datasets.

We evaluate 13 open-source LLMs under a unified, schema-aware protocol. While Qwen3-Coder-30B attains the strongest performance, frequent column-name and variable errors highlight risks for smaller models.

To bridge evaluation with practice, we deploy **VayuChat**, an interactive assistant that delivers real-time, code-backed analysis for Indian policymakers and citizens. Together, VayuBench and VayuChat demonstrate a reproducible pathway from benchmark to verified execution to deployment, establishing the foundations for trustworthy LLM-driven decision support in environmental monitoring.

## Research Context

### The Problem

Air pollution is a severe public health crisis in India, contributing to more than **1.6 million premature deaths annually**. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reduces average life expectancy in India by **over five years**.

Yet, monitoring is only the first step. Turning raw readings into timely, actionable insights for policy remains an unsolved problem:

- **Simple questions are hard**: "How did PM2.5 levels change in Delhi last year?" requires technical expertise
- **Complex analysis is inaccessible**: "Which cities reduced PM2.5 most relative to their NCAP funding?" requires integrating multiple datasets
- **Existing tools fall short**: Demand significant technical skills (R, SQL, Python) or offer only limited visualizations

### The Opportunity

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for translating natural language into executable analyses. In principle, an LLM could:

1. Identify the right datasets
2. Select appropriate statistical operations
3. Generate correct Python code to produce the answer

But their performance on **domain-specific, multi-dataset environmental analytics** remains unexplored.

### Our Approach

VayuBench provides:

- **Domain grounding**: Built from real Indian environmental data (CPCB, NCAP, Census)
- **Executable evaluation**: Verified Python code with sandboxed execution
- **Multi-dataset integration**: Queries require joining pollution, funding, and demographic data
- **Systematic coverage**: Seven query categories reflecting real policy needs

## Methodology

### Stakeholder-Driven Design

We engaged air-quality scientists, academic researchers, and policy think tanks in semi-structured interviews to identify three essential priorities:

1. **Transparency**: Analytical steps must be verifiable
2. **Reproducibility**: Outputs must be consistent and checkable
3. **Accessibility**: Non-technical stakeholders must be able to use the system

These priorities shaped VayuBench's design:

- **Stakeholder Coverage (G1)**: Query types reflect genuine decision-making needs
- **Executable Reliability (G2)**: Test both syntactic and functional correctness
- **Extensible Accessibility (G3)**: Framework supports new datasets and questions

### Benchmark Construction Pipeline

::: {.callout-note}
### Four-Step Process

1. **Seed Question Collection**: 65 base questions grounded in stakeholder needs
2. **Template Design**: Handcrafted templates with placeholders for valid method-column pairs
3. **Systematic Expansion**: ~26K candidate queries generated, sampled to 5K for diversity
4. **Paraphrasing**: LLM paraphrasing + human verification for linguistic variety
:::

### Evaluation Protocol

**Sampling**: For each query, we sample **n = 5** completions using temperature sampling (temperature = 0.8, top-p = 0.95).

**Metrics**:

- **exec@1**: Proportion of samples that execute without error
- **pass@k**: Fraction of queries where at least one of the top-k samples passes all tests
- **Error categorization**: Syntax, Column, Name, Other

**Execution**: Sandboxed subprocess execution with 15-second timeout.

## Results

### Model Performance

- **Best Performance**: Qwen3-Coder-30B achieves **0.99 exec@1** and **0.79 pass@1**
- **Scaling Effect**: Approximately linear relationship between parameters and performance
- **Specialization Advantage**: Code-specialized models outperform general LLMs of similar size

### Error Analysis

- **Column errors dominate**: Nearly 50% of failures across models
- **Schema alignment**: Primary bottleneck, even for top performers
- **Syntax errors rare**: Only in very small models (< 3B parameters)

### Category-Specific Insights

- **Easiest**: Spatial Aggregation (SA) — Simple groupby operations
- **Hardest**: Funding-Based (FQ) — Multi-dataset joins required
- **Most variable**: Spatio-Temporal (STA) — High variance across models

## Impact & Applications

VayuBench enables:

1. **Researchers**: Evaluate LLMs on domain-specific analytics tasks
2. **Model Developers**: Identify weaknesses (e.g., schema alignment) to improve training
3. **Policymakers**: Access air quality insights through natural language (via VayuChat)
4. **Environmental Scientists**: Build trustworthy AI systems for decision support
